>khri focus
With deep breaths, you recall your training and focus your mind to hone in on improving your physical dexterity.

Your focused mind falters, and you feel downright clumsy by comparison.

>khri hasten
Centering your mind, you allow your practiced discipline to spread throughout your body, making thought and motion one.

Your concentration fails, and you feel your body perceptibly slow.

>khri darken
Focusing your mind, you look around yourself to find the subtle differences lurking in the shadows nearby.  After several deep breaths, your senses have attuned themselves to finding the best hiding spots.

You are unable to maintain your focus on the shadows around you, and your knowledge of better hiding places subsides.


>khri prowess
Remembering the mantra of mind over matter, you let your dedicated focus seep into your muscles.  The sensation of believing that your enemies will tremble at the mere thought of you translates from your every movement.

You feel your muscles relax as you settle into a less threatening demeanor.

>khri silence
Turning inwards, you find the still silent spot within you.  Focusing on that point, you allow the silence to spread gently through your body and then out into the world, until you fade away from the world itself.

Your inner silence is lost to the noise and motion of the world around you and you feel your ability to blend in with your surroundings fade.

>khri dampen
Focusing your mind, you attempt to attune your senses to even your most minor movements.  You quickly feel more comfortable with your ability to control your motions to prevent detection.

You are unable to maintain your focus on every movement, and your knowledge of better ways to stay unnoticed in armor subsides.

>khri sight
Darkness is no bar to a trained Thief.  With careful focus, you adjust your eyes to see in shadow as they do in light.

Light and shadow are once again thrown into stark contrast as your heightened vision fades.

>khri avoidance
Taking a deep breath, you focus on making your mind and body one, your mental discipline trained on quickly noticing, analyzing, and dodging approaching threats.

Your concentration runs out, and your rapid analysis of incoming threats ceases.

>khri calm  (No end message for calm)
Placing all of your thoughts and emotions aside, you attempt to mentally expel any foreign influences.

>khri plunder
Your hand twitches slightly in anticipation as you focus your mind towards relieving others of their hard earned possessions.

Your hands feel more clumsy as your intuition on how and when to relieve others of their possessions wanes.

>khri safe
With but a quick thought, your hands steady and your mind gears itself to the purpose of getting into what others want you out of.
Roundtime: 3 sec.

Your hands no longer feel quite as steady as your grasp on the meditation fails.

>khri strike
You calm your body and mind, recalling your training on how to seek the vital part of any opponent.  Wrapping yourself in this cool composure, your eyes quickly become drawn to exposed weaknesses around you.

Your cool composure fades, and with it your heightened knowledge of enemies' weak points.

"shadowstep Letting your thoughts fall into the depths of the self, you discover inner affinity for the shadows, until you are as one of them."
"You can no longer move so quickly through shadows."
